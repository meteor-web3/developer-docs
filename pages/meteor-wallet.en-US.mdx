# Meteor Wallet

[Meteor Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meteor/kcigpjcafekokoclamfendmaapcljead) is a web3 crypto wallet that manages both your finances and personal data.

It is a fully-featured cryptocurrency wallet with additional functionality. Beyond sending transactions, NFTs, interacting with DeFi, etc. you can also create, visualize, and manage your DATA in a decentralized manner.

The wallet acts as a gateway to decentralized data applications (dApps). It prevents malicious applications from stealing your personal data without your consent.

The wallet is designed to protect user signatures and resources authenticated via Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

## Compatible with other wallets

Meteor Wallet introduces a new `WalletsInWallet` architecture for cryptocurrency wallets. This enables users to plug in and connect with Meteor using any wallet they already have installed.
It eases the evolution of crypto wallets from just token management to managing both money and personal data.

Meteor Wallet works as an aggregator for normal cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase, etc. It provides a complete portfolio view and allows you to trade across all assets and connect to any decentralized application with one wallet.

Meanwhile, Meteor Wallet brings new data functionality to all existing wallets. By plugging into Meteor Wallet, your current wallet gains abilities like decentralized data storage, data monetization, data unions, and more.

The `WalletsInWallet` architecture creates a seamless experience for users. They can continue using their preferred wallet while unlocking the full potential of web3 data management offered by Meteor.

We will also further optimise the ease of use and functionality of the wallet by integrating Account Abstraction in the future.

## Secure resources

Meteor Wallet implements safe access controls for resources based on Ethereum Improvement Proposals EIP-4361 (Sign-In with Ethereum) and EIP-5573 (ReCaps).

Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) defines how users can create decentralized identities and authenticate with off-chain applications.

ReCaps extends Sign-In with Ethereum's functionality, enabling users to grant informed consent to applications to act on their behalf after signing in.

By combining these two standards, Meteor Wallet enables users to selectively delegate permissions for applications to handle some of their resources.
This is done by signing messages that inform the user exactly what access they are granting.

</div>

Signed messages (signatures) serve as credentials that grant access to resources.
The security of the signature is equivalent to the security of personal data.
If a user's signatures leak or are compromised, it poses a risk of their web3 resources being stolen or tampered with.
For example, if an unauthorized party gains access to a user's signatures, they could steal, edit or delete a user's personal data.

Meteor Wallet mitigates this risk by storing & protecting user's signatures locally like How MetaMask protects user private key,
and selectively denying access to view or export signatures.

We create Meteor Wallet in purpose to shape a standard for maintaining signature security in a decentralized manner.
We are committed to bringing this security layer to all traditional crypto wallets, making data security a necessary part of wallet services.
Thus users stay in control of their resources while being able to safely leverage decentralized apps.

## DApp authenticator

To prevent malicious applications from disguising themselves and obtaining unauthorized access to a user's resources, Meteor Wallet also functions as an application authenticator.

We maintain a decentralized application registry that provides triple assurance that any app a user connects with is trusted and authorized.
This verification happens through:

- The application's domain name - Meteor Wallet checks that the domain matches the registered name for that app.
- The application's admin key - Each registered app has a unique admin key that Meteor verifies is valid and approved.
- The user's signature - The user signs a message authorizing the specific app domain when first connecting to the app.

Together, these three authentication mechanisms ensure users only connect to legitimate applications.
Before granting any access permissions, Meteor Wallet rigorously validates both the user's approval and the application's registered identity.
