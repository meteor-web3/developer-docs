# DWeb Toolkits

Here, you'll find all the information you need to seamlessly integrate Meteor with various Web3 protocols using our external [DWeb toolkits](https://github.com/meteor-web3/dweb-toolkits).

## Purpose

The purpose of these DWeb toolkits is threefold:

- Ease of Development: Our DWeb toolkits allow developers to easily integrate Meteor with a range of Web3 protocols. This streamlines the development process, enabling you to focus on creating innovative decentralized applications without the complexities of direct protocol integration.

- Encrypted File System Integration: All interactions and creations made using our DWeb toolkits are stored securely in Meteor's built-in encrypted file system. This means you can confidently manage and safeguard user data while maintaining privacy and security.

- Standardized Metadata Layer: Each protocol in the toolkit defines its own file format, which contributes to our vision of creating a standard metadata layer for all protocols within Meteor. This simplifies data management, promotes interoperability, and enriches the overall DWeb experience.

Currently, we offer the following DWeb toolkits ready for use:

### Livepeer Toolkit:

Integrate with the Livepeer protocol for decentralized video streaming, adding a new dimension to your applications.

### Push Toolkit:

Enable secure and private communication with the Push protocol, enhancing user interactions within your decentralized apps.

### XMTP Toolkit:

Seamlessly integrate with the XMTP protocol for confidential messaging, ensuring sensitive communications remain private.

### Lens Toolkit:

Leverage the Lens protocol to create decentralized social platforms, fostering meaningful connections while respecting user privacy.

### Snapshot Toolkit:

Integrate the Snapshot protocol to enable decentralized governance mechanisms in your applications, promoting community-driven decision-making.

### Tableland Toolkit:

Collaborate with the Tableland protocol for decentralized data collaboration, allowing users to share and work on data collaboratively.
