# Wallet Adaptor

In the context of decentralized applications, a wallet adaptor allows you to connect your dApp
with various wallet providers, enabling secure interactions with blockchain networks.
In this section, we'll focus on integrating Meteor Wallet as a wallet provider using wagmi.

## wagmi

[wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) is a JavaScript library that simplifies interactions with Ethereum wallets and providers.
It offers React hooks and components for easy integration with your dApp.

Click on the `Connect Wallet And Capability`. It will open the Meteor Wallet extension Options page
from which you can select the wallet of your choice (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase, Particle).
After connecting your wallet, you can use the react hooks provided by `wagmi` such as `useBalance`, `useEnsName`, etc.
