# Self-host ceramic node

`dapp-backend` is a git repo we're providing to help you deploy a meteor-gated
ceramic node in a easy way. This section is for developers who want to run their own
ceramic node in production. If you just want to use Meteor for testing or learning
, you can skip this section.

**requirements:**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Step 1: Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meteor-web3/dapp-backend
cd dapp-backend
```
## Step2: Generate private key and Admin DID
To generate and fill the private key and admin DID into `.private-key.env` and `daemon.config.json` automatically:

under ```dapp-backend/```
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$PWD/.private-key.env:/data/.private-key.env" \
  -v "$PWD/daemon.config.json:/data/daemon.config.json" \
  meteor/dapp-backend-prerun:latest
```
**Example Result**
```bash
✔ Generating random private key... Done!
8053f2d22cb3da5f84b6f079eb40cdc49958a7da269de3610e63e8b8078f1448
✔ Creating DID... Done!
did:key:z6MkiM1beKfKoNAS5cqHTFMrWAqqHkdb7meMqMBurDDgnTRn
```

Keep your private key safe. You will need it to use the ceramic node.

## Step 3: Configure your ceramic node
copy the config to ceramic config folder

under ```dapp-backend/```
```bash
mkdir ~/.ceramic
cp ./daemon.config.json ~/.ceramic/daemon.config.json
```

## Step 4: Run ceramic node
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will start the ceramic node on port `7007` and the dapp-backend server on `8080`. You can change the port to use by changing the port in the docker-compose.yml file.


### Configure SSL certificate
To let your app connect to the ceramic node safely, you need to configure SSL certificate. 
You can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free SSL certificate.

## [Optional] Run ceramic node on the mainnet

### Verify your email address

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://cas.3boxlabs.com/api/v0/auth/verification \
  
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  --data '{"email": "youremailaddress"}'
```
Then check your email and copy the one time passcode enclosed within. It will be a string of letters and numbers similar to this: 2451cc10-5a39-494d-b8eb-1971ecd813de.
### Send a revocation request
```bash
 curl --request POST \
  --url https://cas.3boxlabs.com/api/v0/auth/did \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "email": "youremailaddress",
      "otp": "youronetimepasscode",
      "dids": [
          "yourdid"
      ]
  }'
  ```
