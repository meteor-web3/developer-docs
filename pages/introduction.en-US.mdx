# What is Meteor?

## Overview

Meteor is the **next-generation personal computer** owned by your wallet.
It is an **Internet Data Operating System** that manages online data for users and eases development of sovereign data dApps.

Meteor is built on top of decentralized web stacks, aimed at reshaping today's internet to forge a Web3 data paradigm - data computed by dApps, stored in personal cloud, sovereigned by users and protected by wallets.

We have consistently emphasized the significance of truly returning data ownership to users.
We believe that merely _acknowledging_ this ownership is not enough; we need to provide rich and user-friendly operability and allow users to profit from their personal data.
Therefore, we build Meteor as a portal to web3 for everyone, which not only stores data but also incentivizes the production of data, maximizes the full potential of data and powers the data economy.

## Advantages

### Identity sovereignty

The whole system is fully controlled by your DID (Decentralized Identifier). With various data dApps running on the OS,
all data generated through interactions with the applications will flow to your encrypted data space,
which can only be accessed and operated by your identity.
As data is the most valuable asset on the internet, it will be portable with your identity,
allowing you to travel with your personal data across various meteor-powered dApps.

### Decentralized storage

The OS utilizes Ceramic - an off-chain decentralized data network built on top of IPFS.
Your files will be saved in a decentralized way, unstoppable, interoperable and easy to access.
Instead of on-chain storage, we choose the right stack to use for delivering a crypto personal data space on the cloud with a rapid & smooth user experience and no transaction fees.

### Data privacy

The OS fulfills the Encryption & Decryption process on the client-side, which means that all data will be encrypted before being sent to the data network.
With the power of Lit Protocol - a distributed key management network, the OS ensures access to data is granted only to the owner of the data or with the owner's authorization (for example, an NFT certificate).

### Built-in data monetization

The OS provides users with native one-click data tokenization. This allows users to share & sell their data to others or a 3-rd party.
The OS uses NFTs as certificates for data access,
promoting a flexibly programmable and easily tradable paradigm of data sharing.
This will facilitate the efficient utilization of data value and foster the prosperity of the data exchange ecosystem.

### Empower super apps

Meteor compresses the complexity of building data dApps with a simple and easy-to-use SDK.
All applications built on top of Meteor conform to the same set of standards set by the system.
The OS creates an ever-evolving, mutually beneficial and interoperable ecosystem of applications.
Developers can build their applications with no backend or database required, and users can access all applications with one single identity.

## The OS composition

Meteor is composed of 3 high-level components, which are:

- **Meteor Cloud** - User-centric storage fully owned by your identity. A cloud drive to store, visualize and monetize all data assets.

- **Meteor Wallet** - A crypto wallet managing both token & data assets.
- **DApp Store** - A secure, open, and innovative platform to discover and experience the latest decentralized applications.

## The underlying technologies

In traditional computer systems, the operating system **controls and coordinates** the use of hardware resources among applications and users.
Similarly, Meteor acts as a resource allocator and control centric for web3 "hardware" — represented by web3 protocols.
These protocols serve as the foundation for various functionalities within the operating system. For example:

### Identity

Meteor offers mechanisms to create and manage personal identities, such as wallet addresses and [PKH DID](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/accounts/pkh-did/).
These identities are designed to be secure and enable users to retain control over their digital presence.

### Decentralized Storage

The operating system utilizes IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) as a storage provider.
This ensures that users can store and retrieve large data without relying on centralized servers.

### Decentralized Databases

Meteor incorporates technologies like [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/), which provides a decentralized graph database.
A secure, web-native file system (WNFS) is built within the operating system to store user data as visualized files. Each user has their own WNFS as dApp storage.

### Access Control

Access control mechanisms are implemented through protocols like [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) (a kind of threshold network),
enabling users to define and manage permissions for data resources via smart contract conditions.
This ensures that users have granular control over who can access their file system and data.

### Data Monetization

Meteor includes [Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/), an on-chain social protocol which also can be used as a tokenization engine that facilitates data monetization.
Users can publish data as on-chain assets and participate in data economy ecosystems,
allowing them to derive value from their personal information.
